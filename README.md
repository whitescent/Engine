# Engine

## Description:

[Engine](https://github.com/whitescent/Engine) is an app that maps your phone to a virtual joystick, 
reads sensor data and allows you to customize the number of buttons and axes, 
allowing you to play various racing games more comfortably than if you only had a keyboard and mouse, such as Assetto Corsa, F1 202x, Euro Truck Simulator 2, etc.
