[Engine](https://github.com/whitescent/Engine) is an app that maps your phone to a virtual joystick, 
reads sensor data and allows you to customize the number of buttons and axes,

* Easy-to-use widget editor
* Several different presets can be set for widgets
* Light and dark color themes supported
* Ability to map the phone's volume keys as buttons to the game (e.g. you can manipulate the volume keys to upshift and downshift your car)
